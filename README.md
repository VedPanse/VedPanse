# 👋 Hey, I’m Ved Panse

**AI Engineer • Systems Programmer • Language Designer**  
Building intelligent systems where **machine learning**, **multi-modal reasoning**, and **programming languages** intersect.

I work on projects that push software beyond traditional boundaries—systems that can see, understand, reason, and execute.

## 🚀 What I’m Building

### 🔥 **javelinLang** — a multi-modal, semantics-aware programming language  
A domain-specific language designed for:
- **semantic reasoning**
- **structural program understanding**
- **multi-modal symbol + token processing**
- **intelligent code analysis**

Think: compiler theory fused with embeddings, structural ML, and agentic behavior.  
A language meant for **AI systems that need to understand programs**, not just run them.

### 🤖 Multi-Modal AI Systems  
I’m especially focused on:
- **vision + language fusion**
- **structural embeddings** for source code, hardware, and natural language  
- **agentic models** that use environment feedback  
- **3D reasoning pipelines** (for robotics, hardware design, or sensor fusion)
- **synthetic vision & perception systems**

I build AI systems that can **observe**, **interpret**, and **act**—not just classify.

## 🤝 I’m Looking to Collaborate On
- multi-modal model pipelines (vision + text + signals)  
- AI-assisted compilers or interpreters  
- intelligent developer tools (semantic search, auto-wiring, structural reasoning)  
- symbolic + neural hybrid systems  
- language models that operate on code ASTs or IRs

If your work pushes the limits of **intelligence, reasoning, or deep systems**, I probably want in.
